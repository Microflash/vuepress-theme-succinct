# Get Started

::: warning
This theme is for Vuepress 1.x which is currently in alpha. I plan to mirror the official versions as it readies for GA. Until then, use this only if you feel adventurous.
:::

Add the dependency to your existing project via Yarn or NPM.

```bash
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-succinct
npm install -D vuepress-theme-succinct
```

Update `.vuepress/config.js` as follows.

```bash
module.exports = {
  theme: 'vuepress-theme-succinct'
}
```

You can also use the shorthand.

```bash
module.exports = {
  theme: 'succinct'
}
```
